# PracticalWork2
For the Practical work i faced some challenges for the most part the challenges i faced was that i needed to remember how to correctly format the code so it wasnt just all to one side like the website i turned in last time which lacked formatting to help me with the formatting i was advised to use a template and i have to say that it has been a major help
